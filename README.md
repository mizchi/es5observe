# What's this?

This is Object.observe Porting to es5 for MVC implements.
I want to use Object.observe and 'updated' event, mainly.
So, Other Events doesn't work correctly.

## Support

- Object.observe
- Object.unobserve

## NOT SUPPORTED

- Custom Event Type
- reconfigured Event

## Notice

if you want to use 'new' event type,
you must initialize as any value when call observe.
it extends some properties for update checking.


I checked only Chrome.
